- Hi, I’m Daniel Scholtus, aka @maddes
- I’m interested in mobile development and data analysis.
- I’m currently learning to integrate React Native with different datasources like:
  - Simple RESTs in Node + Expressjs.
  - GraphQL with Node + Apollo.
  - MongoDB Atlas.
  - AWS Lambda + DynamoDB, etc...
- I’m looking to collaborate on non-profit development of apps that will help the modern minds reconnect with the Bible.
  - Some personal projects I'm already working on:
    - 7th day Adventists Beliefs mobile app. Summaries to keep at hand and share, related hymns, sermons and extended lessons about each core belief: https://www.adventist.org/beliefs/
    - WisdomTree. Put simple: "A Duolingo-like app to study the Bible".
    - 7th day Adventists Hymnal: One of the first Android I ever made a decade ago. I intend to complete a full modern revamp with Material design, spring animations and React Native.
  - Some personal projects I've on backlog:
    - Reference material
      - Interactive Bible History and Archeological guide.
      - 7th day Adventist Biblical Commentary for mobile.
      - Ellen G. White Q&A reference site/app, stackoverflow style.
    - Growthn & Evangelism
      - Modern Pathfinders badges: coding, networking, IT security, video-editing, ...
      - AI Evangelizer. A complex version of the simple "guess the animal" machine learning game to provide theological answers.
    - Social
      - Adventist video-series: Netflix-style service with revival series from Pr Andrés Portes and **few** others.
      - University courses campus app for enhanced lectures organization and students communication.
      - Adventist Book club, read together and share reviews and lessons.
    - Media & worship
      - Geo-based Adventist songbook. Step into a church and have the songbook adapt to local lyrics and favorites.
    - Tools
      - Bibleworks-like app online or mobile app for advanced biblical research.
      - Elders toolbelt. Leadership material: Training courses for teaching (homiletics, counseling, ...) and bible research (exegesis), reference sermons, lessons and studies (soteriology, prophecy, escathology, ...), complementary bible training materials (archeology, languages, ...), recommended readings, ...
      - Kickstarter and Flattr style apps to support laic adventists relief and evangelical efforts.
